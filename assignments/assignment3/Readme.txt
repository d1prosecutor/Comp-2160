I have included this readme to explain that i didn't know that you could overwrite an assignment after the
deadline to submit it has crossed and so i must have mistakenly typed A3 in an attempt to submit a4 and i didn't 
think it would be a problem because the due date had already crossed. Luckily, i implement version control in my assignments
and i have gone to my github t get the files that were last modified on the due date (21st of November) and i have included the screenshots
in the folder named 'proof'. I also spoke to Professor about this and he instructed me to do exactly this. I hope you reconsider remarking my work.
Thanks.
